-Diff between BST and BT
1)BST is node based where each child nodes has further left and right subtree that are BST too. 
In BT is unordered
2)BST if faster for insert,deletes and searches than BT as it is ordered
3)BST left subtree has items less than the node while right subtree is vice versa

-Duplicates in BST:
By definition dups are not allowed but can be exempted using one of the following three options.
-Have a count for each value along with its left and right child
-Have a separate hashmap with the keys and their frequency, the BST however will only have one occurence for each value.
-Insert the same keys either left or right of the main key. Eg new 8 will be added immediately after the prev 8 and the subtree will be attached to the new 8.

#TRaversing through a BT:
-REcursion:Pre/Post/In
-Iteration: Level
-Can be used either ways

#Level order traversal:
Use a queue for Iterative approach
Use a stack+level

-Number of Unique BST for n nodes:
**Catalan Number:
C(n+1)=(2(2n+1)/(n+2))*C(n)   OR C(n)=(2n)!/((n+1)!*n!) OR 
Check notes for generating function

-AVL Trees:
AVL trees invented to overcome the drawbacks of the BT when it becomes imbalanaced.
As in only left node of root are filled, which behaves like a linked list and give O(n) instead of O(log n) for search,addition and deletion

-At most height of AVL tree=1.44 log n, if there are n nodes in the tree.
-Time to search/insert/delete-O(logn)

-Red Black Tree:
To avoid the frequent rotations performed on AVL trees, Red-Blac trees are used.
